            Amanda Barone is a Registered Acupuncturist with the
            College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner’s
            and Acupuncturists of Ontario (CTCMPAO). Growing up
            as a competitive figure skater lead her to have a 
            constant fascination with the human body and how it
            functions. This inspired her to enroll in the 
            Kinesiology and Health Sciences program at 
            York University. Upon graduation, she continued her
            studies at the Toronto School of Traditional
            Chinese Medicine (TSTCM) and graduated with a 
            Diploma in Acupuncture. It was here that she 
            learned the intricate relationship between a
            person’s physical, emotional and spiritual 
            health and the impact this has on one’s overall 
            health and
            wellness.
